# Huffman Coding
## AIM:
To implement Huffman coding to compress the data using Python.

## SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
1. Anaconda - Python 3.7

## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Get the input string.
### Step 2:
Create tree nodes.
### Step 3:
Define main function to implement Huffman Coding.
### Step 4:
Calculate frequency of occurence.
### Step 5:
Print the characters and it huffman code.
 
## PROGRAM:
``` Python
# Get the input String



# Create tree nodes



# Main function to implement huffman coding



# Calculate frequency of occurrence




# Print the characters and its huffmancode





```
## OUTPUT:

### Print the characters and its huffmancode

## RESULT:
Thus, the huffman coding was implemented to compress the data using python programming.
